This is a website crawler that I have created using scrapy in Pyhton script.
I have  tried to scraped two websites 'http://quotes.toscrape.com/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning'
In these websites I have scraped all the contents of <p>tag.

The path to the spider that I have created is scrapy->scrape->tutorial->spiders->quotes_spider.
